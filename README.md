## SWAPI & Backbone.js Models
Challenge: Load data from a restful api into a Backbone Collection with fetch()  
Challenge 2: Persist new data to an API endpoint  
Challenge 3: Edit existing data and save it back to the API endpoint  

This project used Backbone.js models and collections to fetch and push data
from and to API endpoints. It used Bootstrap layout and components for page
layout and Handlebars templates to populate data on the page. This was a one day
project and is live here (note the server used only serves 10 entries at a time): http://dalevfenton.github.io/tiy-6.2-loading/
